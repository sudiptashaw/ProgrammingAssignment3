Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Project Assignment

This repository contains the R code and documentation files for Coursera's Data Science specialization course "Getting and Cleaning data".

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files

`README.md.md` is this file you are reading now.

`CodeBook.md` describes the how to use variables, data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the cleanup and analysis described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
